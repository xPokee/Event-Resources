### Credits:

The sprites used for the compression kit were taken from https://github.com/Citadel-Station-13/Citadel-Station-13/pull/8484,
which this lua script is inspired by and based off of.

All of the credit for the ideas, original code, and of course, the sprites go to BlackMajor, the creator of that PR.

The lua script itself was done by me, xPokee.
